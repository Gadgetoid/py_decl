# py_decl

A Python parser for the Raspberry Pi binary declaration metadata.

## TODO

* Make this actually good
* Add support for parsing .bin files
* Support everything that's currently missing
* Package up into a library that parses a supplied file and returns a dict
* Add CI and tests + test with more files!

## Special Thanks

* I would not have figured out this stuff without the README at https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-binary-info
